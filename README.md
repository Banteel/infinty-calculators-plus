# infinty-calculators-plus
Repository for Infinty calculations regarding equations that calculate all the way up to infinty and the beyond.

The sub-calculator InfintyPlus.py here in the sub-calculators-plus Python repository is based on sub-calculations derived from two separate equations resulting in the same output where the numbers entered are irrelevant towards the full math output. Meaning the usable output from the results is the sub-calculations from "sectioned consecutive adjacent pieces (connected)" where each sub calculated piece's (usable) output is different from the output results of both the full math equation's output. These sub-calculations creates usable output for equations that are, for example, consistently unchanging results irrelevant of the input.

For further description regarding "Sub-calculations" see online MATH websites providing a more detailed explanation by searching Mathematical Terms like: "MATH Sub-calculation".
